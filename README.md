# Mujoco Environments
`mj_envs` is a collection of environments/tasks simulated with the [Mujoco](http://www.mujoco.org/) physics engine and wrapped in the OpenAI `gym` API.

## Getting Started
`mj_envs` uses git submodules to resolve dependencies. Please follow steps exactly as below to install correctly.

1. Clone this repo with pre-populated submodule dependencies
```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/vikashplus/mj_envs.git
```
2. Install package using `pip`
```
$ pip install -e .
```
**OR**
Add repo to pythonpath by updating `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`
```
export PYTHONPATH="<path/to/mj_envs>:$PYTHONPATH"
```
3. You can visualize the environments with random controls using the below command
```
$ python utils/visualize_env.py --env_name hammer-v0
```
**NOTE:** If the visualization results in a GLFW error, this is because `mujoco-py` does not see some graphics drivers correctly. This can usually be fixed by explicitly loading the correct drivers before running the python script. See [this page](https://github.com/aravindr93/mjrl/tree/master/setup#known-issues) for details.

# modules
*mj_envs* contains a variety of environements, which are organized as modules. Each module is a collection of loosely related environements. Following modules are provided at the moment with plans to improve the diversity of the collection.

## 1. Hand Manipulation Suite (HMS)
HMS contains a collection of environements centered around dexterous manipulation with anthroporphic 24 degrees of freedom  [Adroit Hand](https://vikashplus.github.io/P_Hand.html). These environments were designed for the publication: [Learning Complex Dexterous Manipulation with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Demonstrations, RSS2018](https://sites.google.com/corp/view/deeprl-dexterous-manipulation).
