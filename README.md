`RoboHive` is a collection of environments/tasks simulated with the [MuJoCo](http://www.mujoco.org/) physics engine exposed using the OpenAI-Gym API.

## Getting Started
   Getting started with RoboHive is as simple as -
   ``` bash
   # Install RoboHive and demo an environemnt
   pip install robohive
   cd robohive
   python robohive/utils/examine_env.py -e FrankaReachRandom-v0
   ```
   See here for [detailed installation instructions](./setup/README.md) and [frequently asked questions](./setup/FAQ.md).

# Suites
*RoboHive* contains a variety of environement, which are organized as suites. Each suites is a collection of loosely related environements. Following suites are provided at the moment with plans to improve the diversity of the collection.

## 1. Hand Manipulation Suite
HMS contains a collection of environement centered around dexterous manipulation with
simulated actuators:
- anthroporphic 24 degrees of freedom  [Adroit Hand](https://vikashplus.github.io/P_Hand.html). These environments were designed for the publication: [Learning Complex Dexterous Manipulation with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Demonstrations, RSS2018](https://sites.google.com/corp/view/deeprl-dexterous-manipulation).
