`RoboHive` is a collection of environments/tasks simulated with the [MuJoCo](http://www.mujoco.org/) physics engine exposed using the OpenAI-Gym API.

## Getting Started
   Getting started with RoboHive is as simple as -
   ``` bash
   # Install RoboHive and demo an environemnt
   pip install robohive
   python -m robohive.utils.examine_env -e FrankaReachRandom-v0
   ```

   or, alternatively,

   ``` bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/vikashplus/robohive.git; cd robohive
   pip install -e .
   python -m robohive.utils.examine_env -e FrankaReachRandom-v0
   ```

   See [detailed installation instructions](./setup/README.md) for options on mujoco-python-bindings and  visual-encoders ([R3M](https://sites.google.com/view/robot-r3m/), [RRL](https://sites.google.com/view/abstractions4rl), [VC](https://eai-vc.github.io/)), and [frequently asked questions](https://github.com/vikashplus/robohive/wiki/6.-Tutorials-&-FAQs#installation) for more details.

# Suites
*RoboHive* contains a variety of environement, which are organized as suites. Each suites is a collection of loosely related environements. Following suites are provided at the moment with plans to improve the diversity of the collection.

## - Hand Manipulation Suite

   This suite contains a collection of environement centered around dexterous manipulation. Standard ADROIT benchmarks introduced in [Learning Complex Dexterous Manipulation with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Demonstrations, RSS2018](https://sites.google.com/corp/view/deeprl-dexterous-manipulation).) are a part of this suite
## - Arm Manipulation Suite

   This suite contains a collection of environement centered around Arm+Gripper manipulation.

## - Myo Suite

   This suite contains a collection of environements related to biomechanics. Standard [MyoSuite benchmarks](https://sites.google.com/view/myosuite) are a part of this suite

## - MultiTask Suite

   This suite contains a collection of environement centered around multi-tassk. Standard [RelayKitchen benchmarks](https://relay-policy-learning.github.io/) are a part of this suite
## - TCDM Suite (WIP)
   This suite contains a collection of environement centered around dexterous manipulation. Standard [TCDM benchmarks](https://pregrasps.github.io/) are a part of this suite

## - ROBEL Suite (Coming soon)
   This suite contains a collection of environement centered around real world locomotion and manipulation. Standard [ROBEL benchmarks](http://roboticsbenchmarks.org/) are a part of this suite
